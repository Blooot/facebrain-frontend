This project is from when I was first learning about JavaScript/etc. The site is no longer serviced, but it was a project that utilized clarif.ai to count and circle human faces in images. It allowed users to upload photos then circled the found faces.

Frontend for facebrain!

React, tachyons, and the clarifai face detect api.
